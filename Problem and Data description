[Introduction/Business Problem]

In this capstone project I am going to accomplish a classification problem about New York Parking Violation. To be specific,
the type of different parking violation is supposed to be relational to the location of the violation location. The hypothesis
will be that the information of the location may help predict(classify) different type of parkin violation.
The target of this project will be New York police department. New York police will be interested in this problem because this
will help police department deploying police power in advance.

[Data]

New York parking violation data can be accessed through the link 
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2016/kiv2-tbus
This dataset contains the location and parking violation type(which is encoded by the police department).
I will use the Foursquare API to extract venue information around the parking violation location, such as the number of 
restaurants and parks, and other kinds of venue information, like what is done in the lab.
After getting the venue information, model such as SVM or KNN will be used to classify and predict different type of parking 
violation based on location.
